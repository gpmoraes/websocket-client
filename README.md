# PHP WebSocket Example

This is an example of how to use the PHP WebSocket extension to open a WebSocket connection to a server, send data through the connection, and receive data from the connection. The WebSocket protocol is a protocol for real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and a server. It allows for low latency communication and is useful for applications such as chat, gaming, and live updates.

## Opening a connection
The code starts by opening a WebSocket connection to the server at IP address 127.0.0.1 on port 2246 using the `websocket_open` function. This function takes in a URL as a parameter and creates a connection to the server using the `fsockopen` function. It starts by creating a key using the `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes` and `base64_encode` functions, which is used to encrypt the WebSocket connection. Then it creates an HTTP header that includes the key and sends it to the server to request an upgrade to a WebSocket connection. If the server accepts the upgrade, the function returns the socket pointer.

## Sending data
Once the connection is open, the code sends a message containing the data "text" in JSON format to the server using the `websocket_write` function. This function takes in a socket pointer, the data to be sent, and a boolean indicating whether or not this is the final message. It starts by creating a WebSocket frame header, which includes information about the type of message, its length, and whether or not it is the final message. Then it applies a mask to the data, which encrypts it before sending it to the server.

## Reading data
The code then reads the response from the server using the `websocket_read` function and echoes it to the screen. This function takes in a socket pointer, a boolean indicating whether or not to wait for the end of the message, and a reference to an error variable. It reads the header of the WebSocket frame and the data, and it uses the information in the header to determine the length of the data and if this is the final message. It then returns the data read from the socket.

It's important to note that this code uses a WebSocket extension that is not present in all PHP installations, and it may be necessary to install it before using this code. Additionally, this code is a simple example, and it is important to implement proper error handling and security measures in a real-world application.
